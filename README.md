## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Omni3D, originally developed by [Garrick Brazil et al.](https://garrickbrazil.com/omni3d), is a state-of-the-art model for 3D object detection. This project incorporates a custom tracking mechanism to extend the detection capabilities, enabling real-time object tracking in various environments.

For more details on the Omni3D project, refer to the [original repository](https://garrickbrazil.com/omni3d).

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n cubercnn python=3.8
source activate cubercnn

# Install main dependencies
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge -c pytorch3d -c pytorch fvcore iopath pytorch3d pytorch=1.8 torchvision=0.9.1 cudatoolkit=10.1

# Install additional dependencies
pip install cython opencv-python
pip install 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
python -m pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu101/torch1.8/index.html
conda install -c conda-forge scipy seaborn
```

## Running the Demo <a name="demo"></a>

You can run the Omni3D demo with tracking enabled using the following commands:

```bash
# Download sample images
sh demo/download_demo_COCO_images.sh

# Run the demo with the custom tracker
python demo/demo_detection.py \
--config-file cubercnn://omni3d/cubercnn_DLA34_FPN.yaml \
--input-folder "datasets/coco_examples" \
--threshold 0.25 --display \
MODEL.WEIGHTS cubercnn://omni3d/cubercnn_DLA34_FPN.pth \
OUTPUT_DIR output/demo_with_tracking
```


## Running the Demo with Tracker <a name="demo"></a>

You can run the Omni3D demo with tracking enabled using the following commands:

```bash
# Download sample images
sh demo/download_demo_COCO_images.sh

# Run the demo with the custom tracker
python demo/demo_tracker.py \
--config-file cubercnn://omni3d/cubercnn_DLA34_FPN.yaml \
--input-video "demo/video_indoor2.mp4" \
--threshold 0.40 --display 

```


## Training <a name="training"></a>

To train the Omni3D model with tracking, use the same Omni3D setup as described in the [original Omni3D repository](https://garrickbrazil.com/omni3d), with the following command:

```bash
python tools/train_net.py \
  --config-file configs/Base_Omni3D.yaml \
  OUTPUT_DIR output/omni3d_with_tracking
```

## Inference <a name="inference"></a>

To run inference, use:

```bash
python tools/train_net.py \
  --eval-only --config-file cubercnn://omni3d/cubercnn_DLA34_FPN.yaml \
  MODEL.WEIGHTS cubercnn://omni3d/cubercnn_DLA34_FPN.pth \
  OUTPUT_DIR output/evaluation
```

## Tracker Implementation <a name="tracker"></a>

This project adds an object tracker to the original Omni3D model, allowing for multi-frame tracking of detected objects. The tracker matches detected objects across frames based on a custom algorithm that utilizes 3D bounding box information, object centers, and category types.

Key features of the tracker:
- Custom matching logic for continuous tracking of objects over time
- Handling of high-cost matches across consecutive frames
- Integration with Omni3D’s 3D detection pipeline


# Chat with Phi-3 Vision

This folder is part of the **Monocular 3D Object Detection and Tracking** project and contains a Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with a vision model, specifically Phi-3 Vision, to analyze images and return detailed descriptions of their contents.

## Overview

The application is designed to:
- Receive images from a server via a socket connection.
- Allow users to enter specific requests regarding the description of the images.
- Leverage the Phi-3 Vision model to generate accurate and detailed image descriptions.

Key features:
- **Real-time communication** with a server for image acquisition.
- **Text-based interaction** for requesting specific details about an image.
- **Automatic handling of inputs**, where image frames are fetched automatically upon submission of a user query.
- **Customizable chat interface**, which automatically resets after each response.
- **Responsive interface** that adapts to the user's input with minimal interaction, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Installation

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramonatarantino/mocular-3d-object-detection-tracking.git
   cd mocular-3d-object-detection-tracking/chat-with-phi-3-vision
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   Launch the Streamlit app by running the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   Make sure the server providing the image stream is running and accessible.

## Usage

1. After launching the app, you'll see a chat interface where you can submit queries about the images being streamed.
2. The Phi-3 Vision model will analyze the current frame and provide a detailed response based on the query.
3. You can refine your requests in natural language, and the app will process the input and update with a new description.

## Customization

### Input Behavior
- The input bar is fixed to the bottom of the interface for easy access. It automatically fetches a new frame when you hit "Enter" after typing your query.

### Image Processing
- Images are processed in real-time as they are received from the server. There is no need to manually click any buttons—everything happens seamlessly after a user submits their request.

### Hidden Features
- Advanced settings are embedded in the code but not visible on the user interface, keeping the layout clean and user-friendly.
